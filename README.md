# AlgaLite

## Introduction

Hello there! Welcome to the [AlgaLite](https://hackaday.io/project/191794-algalite) project, a living lamp focuses on circularity of energy and mass using the power of biology.

This project is an ode to MicroAlgae. Fantastic little microbes that keep our world together by cycling CO2 into Oxygen and serving as a food source at the bottom of the food pyramid. (and sometimes at the top).

Functionally, it's an LED lamp that's controllable via WiFi. But rather than simply wasting the photons generated by the LEDs, the light is passed through a container with microalgae inside it. They absorb the photons and CO2 and any nutrients in water to produce more algae biomass.

The project makes use of simple components found on and can be built relatively cheaply. A starter culture can be sourced from a local repository of algae and protozoa.
Make your next home improvement project a green (and living one)!
